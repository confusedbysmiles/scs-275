SCS 275 - Comp Security Networks & Mobile
===================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the materials for the course SCS 275 - Comp Security Networks & Mobile at [Seton Hill University](http://www.setonhill.edu).  It is being taught at SHU for the first time in the spring 20 semester, so the content of this repo will be filled in as the semester progresses.  The content can be viewed online at [http://confusedbysmiles.github.io/scs-275](http://confusedbysmiles.github.io/scs-275).

Students *currently* in the course should view the [shu/index.html](shu/index.html) ([md](shu/index.md)) file in the **cloned** repository (i.e., don't try to view it on github.com); current students may also want to view the [daily announcements](shu/daily-announcements.html#/).  Note that many of the course materials are modified right before they are needed -- for example, this repository will be updated right before the semester starts.
