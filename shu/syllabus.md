## Quick version

I realize that not everybody reads these through.  So the TL;DR version:

- This course organized through Canvas, and the Canvas workspace is [here](https://shu.instructure.com/courses/32487)
- Two midterms: Friday, February 27th and Friday, April 3rd, both online via Canvas. Both midterms will require Lockdown Browser.
- The final is can be taken at any time between May 12th and 14th.
- We have a fairly unique extension system used in this class -- be sure you understand it (and the limitations)
- Grades are 15% each midterm, 25% final exam, 40% homeworks, and 5% participation
- Most things are going to be auto-graded, but you can submit multiple times; the grades won't be known until the late due date has passed
- If you encounter any rough spots in the course -- please be patient, and provide constructive feedback, and I'll do my best to get it all fixed
- There will be both larger programming homeworks and smaller tutorial-style  homeworks or readings -- sometimes one of each will be assigned at any given time
- Readings will typically have in-class quizzes when they are due
- Office hours are by appointment. [Book here.](https://fantastical.app/sservellon/scs275-75-spring26)
I want you to succeed in this course and enjoy it – if you are having any problems (personal, academic, what-not) that I can help with, please let me know

And now for the really long-winded version...

Coordination is through (https://shu.instructure.com/courses/32487our Canvas workspace)
Email: please use the course contact email (listed on the Canvas landing page)
Announcements will be typically done through the [slide set](daily-announcements.html#/daily announcements)

[Course content:] Much of the the course content is available free online at (http://confusedbysmiles.github.io/icshttp://confusedbysmiles.github.io/ics), which is from a public Github repository: (https://github.com/confusedbysmiles/icshttps://github.com/confusedbysmiles/scs-275). All the source code in that repository is released under a (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.htmlGPL 3.0 license), and all the non-source code material in that repository is released under a (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/Creative Commons license) (CC BY-SA). Note that this license and the public availability does NOT apply to the lecture videos.

[Lectures:] There are no scheduled meeting times, however, there will be a few discussion assignments that will count for your participation grade.
[Readings:] Due to the rapidly changing nature of this topic, there is no assigned textbook. Various online readings will be assigned. You should expect a reading quiz on the day that a reading is due. All quizzes will be online in Canvas.
[Purchases:] As mentioned above, no textbook is required for this course. You don’t have to purchase anything else for this course. But you do have to have a relatively modern <em>notebook</em> computer (any computer purchased in the last 3 or so years will suffice). If you do not have one, or yours breaks during the semester, get in touch with us as the department can loan you one.
[Technology Requirements:] You will need to create a free [Amazon Web Services account](https://aws.amazon.com/) to create a virtual Linux box for you to complete the course work in. (They will put a $1 charge on whatever card you give them on the off chance you were to go over on the number of free hours.)
[Course Description:] Introduces basic computer security concepts and methods. Explains concerns regarding computer security and describes methods to provide various forms of computer security and implement some of these methods. Primarily based on UNIX/Linux (for uniformity and security issues) but also explains Windows-based concepts when applicable.

The course objectives are:

- Understand the ethical and policy context for cybersecurity in today's society
- Understand how to better safeguard one's personal computer
- Understand the basics of advanced topics in cybersecurity including encryption, digital forensics, binary exploits, and networks
- Understand the modern concepts in cybersecurity attacks and prevention

**Availability:** It is important to me to be available to my students, and to address their concerns. If you cannot meet with me during office hours, e-mail (or, ideally, submit a email ticket) and I will try to find the time to meet. That being said, like everybody else I am quite busy, so it may take a day or more to find a time to meet. And if you have any comments on the course -- what is working, what is not working, what can be done better, etc. -- I am very interested in hearing about them. There is an anonymous feedback tool through Canvas, or you can send me an e-mail.

**Prerequisites:** SCS 132 (Prog I: Intro to Development) and SCS 141 (Prog II: Mobile App Development) OR SCS 142 (Programming II: Math & Engineering), each with a grade of C- or above. As per departmental policy, this pre-req will be checked, and if it is not met, you will be de-registered from the course.

**Grades:** Grades will be calculated by the following formula:

- Programming and written assignments (40%)
- Midterms (15% each)
- Final exam (25%)
- Class participation, pop quizzes (5%)

I *expect* that grades will follow the standard decade curve: 90 and above is an A of some sort (A-, A, or A+), 80 and above is some sort of a B, etc.  **Note:** I reserve the right to modify the weighting (changing the curve, adding pop quizzes, etc.), especially if attendance drops off significantly.  In particular, if the grade averages are very high, then you will need higher than a 90 to get an A-.

**Participation:** The participation grade is handled very differently as this is an online, asychronous course and will be based entire in the Discussion board section of Canvas.

**Assignments:** During a regular (fall or spring) semester, the intent is for there to be one assignment due every week (except the week of the midterm and Thanksgiving week).  A typical module will have two assignments.  During a summer term, there will be less than that.  The written homeworks will be submitted as a PDF, and will consist of writing, math, and short programs.   All submissions are through Gradescope, the link to which is on the Canvas landing page.  Due to the class size, and the limited TA support, all the programming assignments will be auto-graded.  You will need to be familiar with the [homework policies](hw-policies.html) ([md](hw-policies.md)), as you will be bound by them on the assignments.

**Course rules:** You are fully responsible for all material presented in class and on the required readings. Exams and due dates are scheduled in advance. A grade of zero will be recorded for missed exams and late assignments unless prior arrangements are made (see below for details) or there are truly extenuating circumstances (which will require appropriate documentation). Assignments turned in after the due date are penalized 25% per day (or fraction thereof) late; this means a maximum of 3 days (i.e. 72 hours) late. In most cases, you are free to develop assignments on any language/platform/OS you wish. Some assignments may require a specific operating system setup, or a particular required programming language, which will be provided if necessary.  However, you are responsible for porting your code to the system the class is using and ensuring that it runs correctly for us when we grade your assignment. Our reference system will specified for each assignment, but will generally be Ubuntu Linux.  The Gradescope submission auto-grader will verify this upon submission (and immediately report the results back to you). Most assignments will be graded by automated testing.

**Disabilities:**  If you have a disability that may require consideration by the instructor, you should contact Terri Bassi-Cook, the Director of Disability Services at 724-838-4295 or tbassicook@setonhill.edu and/or disabilityservices@setonhill.edu as soon as possible to develop a plan of accommodation. After your accommodations have been established you should schedule a brief online meeting with your instructor to discuss the implementation of your accommodations in this course. It is not necessary to disclose to your instructor the nature of your disability. If you need accommodations for successful participation in class activities prior to your appointment at the Disability Services Office, you should offer information in writing via email to your instructor which includes suggestions for assistance in participating in and completing class assignments.

**Special Circumstances:** Students with special circumstances (athletics, extra time required on exams, final exam conflicts, DDS considerations, etc.) need to let me know as soon as possible.

**Extensions and late submissions:** Assignments turned in after the due date are penalized 25% per day (or fraction thereof) late; this means a maximum of 3 days (i.e. 72 hours) late.  For example, anywhere from 1 second late to 24 hours late receives 25% percent off.

You may request an extension on any assignment (PA or PS) for any reason -- there is an automated system, linked to from the Canvas landing page, for this.  That extension is 4 days.  HOWEVER, you only have 8 such "free late passes" during the semester -- once they are used up, there will not be any more.  An extension will delay the onset of the late penalty -- so if you get an extension, then the late penalty does not kick in until the 5th day after the due date.

This extension rule does not apply to quizzes, exams, or any in-class activities.  It only applies to programming assignments (PAs) and written assignments (PSs).

However, there are a few specifics to this extension rule:

- As mentioned above, you only have 8 such free late passes to use throughout the semester
- The extension request must be submitted no later than 3 days after the (regular) due date.  We will not consider anybody that misses this date (it actually should be in before the due date itself, but we are giving you 3 days to submit after that point).
- This extension time covers any and all situations:     travel, holidays, being busy, family emergencies, DDS (generally), dog ate your homework, religious observances, interviews, thunderstorms, power outages, temporal dislocation, etc.
- We are not expecting to allow any further extensions beyond this 4 days, unless there are considerable extenuating circumstances -- basically, something that would have granted an extension for more than 4 days in the first place.  If you get busy or sick at the end of your 4 day extension request, then that's your tough luck.
- After you extension ends, the late penalty (above) kicks in for the next three days.
- This policy *already includes* DDS accommodations less than 4 days (we are just extending these accommodations to everybody).  Likewise, religious accommodations of a short time (a few days) are handled by this policy as well.  
- If there is a valid need for an extended accommodation -- DDS, religious, health, etc. -- please chat with one of the instructors, and we'd be happy to discuss it with you.
- For written assignments, if you turn your assignment in on time, then that will be the version graded -- you can't turn it in on time, then file an extension, then submit it later, and expect the later version to be graded.  We will have already started grading the on-time submissions, and we just don't have the staffing capacity to grade multiple submissions from students.
- This means that any written assignment turned in after the due date, whether late or via an extension, will end up taking much longer to be graded.
- TA and instructor office hours are optimized for the actual due date -- if you file for an extension, there may not be sufficient office hours available for when you plan to submit it.  Also, the next week's office hours will have to focus on the assignment due that week.


**Grading:** Programming assignments are auto-graded, and will be returned after the end of the extension and late period -- which means after 8 days after the due date.  The provided input and required output will be clearly specified in the assignment write-up.  When you submit your assignment, a few *acceptance* tests will be run.  These tests are meant to ensure that your program works with the required input and output.  They will test the provided examples in the assignment write-up, but they are ***NOT*** meant to be comprehensive.  Your grade will ***NOT*** be based on the acceptance tests -- instead, there will be a separate battery of comprehensive tests that will be used to determine your grade.  These tests (and their results) will not be revealed until the homework is returned -- if they were, then one could just write a program with only `print()` statements to pass all those tests.

**Exams:** There will be two midterms and a final exam.  Dates are shown above and on the Canvas landing page.

Under **NO** circumstances will anybody be allowed to take the final exam early.  You may **ONLY** request to take the final exam at a different time if you have a final exam **CONFLICT**, not a busy final exam schedule.  Since there are no other exams scheduled during that time, it is unlikely that you will have a conflict.  You have to be present, in person, at the final exam period.

**Regrades:** You may submit graded homeworks and exams for regrading within one week of when they are returned to you (less time for the final due to the end of the semester).  Regrades are submitted via Gradescope (for written assignments) or email tickets (for programming assignments).  As long as people submit responsibly, I will not institute a frivolous regrade policy that existed in some earlier semesters (if one is instituted, you will be told of this ahead of time).  This time limit will be strictly enforced.

**Academic Integrity:** The SHU Academic Honesty Code is in effect for this course.  There is one course specific addition: You may not look at any other student's code for ANY reason, period.  Not to debug, not to help, not to learn.  You may not let another student look at *your* code for any reason.  Needless to say, you cannot copy code from online sources unless the assignment specifically allows it (and in those cases, you must cite your source).  The next paragraph describes this more.

Students are encouraged to discuss programs and assignments in general. However, helping others find bugs in existing programs, using another person's code, or writing code for someone else is cheating and a violation of the University's Academic Integrity Policy. Basically, you should not be looking at another person's code for **ANY** reason (obviously you can after BOTH have submitted the assignment, or if there is a group project). This includes consulting programming solutions to assignments from previous years. This also includes looking up solutions online.  Any violation or cheating will be referred to the academic Integrity committee, and will result in an *immediate failure for the course*, regardless of the outcome of the honor trial or your other grades. No exceptions! I am very strict on this!

**Generative AI:** Unless stated otherwise, you may NOT use any generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to write the code of the assignments.  Note that there is one assignment (Ethics) where you are specifically instructed to do so.  If you want to figure out how to do something small, such as how to perform a substring in Python, that's fine, as that is analogous to looking it up on stackoverflow.  You must cite any and all generative AI that you use in such a manner (a one-line comment above the line you got this way is sufficient).

## Life

Bad things happen. People forget things and make mistakes. Bad days coincide with due dates. etc.  We aim to have our extension policy, above, help to cover these types of issues.  If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to your professor and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.  Note that there needs to be a significant reason for this, as we already are providing a free 4 day extension.




### Students with disabilities or learning needs

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Department of Disability Services (DDS) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations or general questions please visit the <a href="disabilityservices@setonhill.edu">DDS website</a>. If you have already been approved for accommodations through DDS, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.
<p>Note that we expect most (or perhaps all) accommodation requests will be handled by our extension policy, above.

As your professors and as people, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 

### Starfish

This course is using Starfish to provide feedback on your class performance.  A Starfish notification may be sent to your Seton Hill email. For example, you may receive an academic alert notification if you are struggling, or you may get a kudos message indicating you are doing well.  All Starfish notifications support your learning and academic success.  Please check your Seton Hill email often and promptly respond to any Starfish emails that require action on your part.  You can also view notifications and additional student success information in the Starfish system found at MySHU>App Launcher (in the upper right corner)
